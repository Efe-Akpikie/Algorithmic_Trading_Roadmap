**Roadmap for Books to make an Expert Algorithmic Trader**

**Books under a module will be read concurrently**



Each Module will take 4 months to complete and you must spend 2 months after to work on trading algorithms/projects



**1.) Foundations of Statistical \& Systematic Trading**

* Statistics and Data Analysis for Financial Engineering by Ruppert
* Introduction to Statistical Learning by Hastie
* Successful Algorithmic Trading by Michael-Halls-Moore
* The Elements of Quantitative Investing by Giuseppe



**Skills I'll gain after completing:** You’ll build a rigorous statistical foundation for financial data, including regression, classification, factor modeling, and proper backtesting discipline. You’ll be able to design, evaluate, and deploy simple but robust systematic strategies with sound data hygiene and risk awareness.



**2.) Probabilistic Modeling, Time Series \& Portfolio Construction**

* Applied Time Series Analysis and Forecasting with Python by Changquan Huang
* Bayesian Modeling and Computation in Python by Osvaldo A. Martin
* Advanced Algorithmic Trading by Michael-Halls-Moore
* Advanced Portfolio Management by Giuseppe



**Skills I'll gain after completing:** You’ll master time-series modeling (ARIMA, state-space, volatility models) and Bayesian inference for uncertainty-aware decision making. You’ll be able to translate forecasts into position sizing, portfolio construction, and capital allocation rules that survive regime shifts.





**3.) Machine Learning \& Modern Quant Portfolio Engineering**

* Analysis of Financial Time Series by Ruel S. Tsay
* Machine Learning for Algorithmic Trading by Jansen
* Quantitative Portfolio Management in python by Brugière
* Advances in Financial Machine Learning by Prado



**Skills I'll gain after completing:** You’ll learn to apply ML correctly in finance: feature engineering, labeling, cross-validation, meta-labeling, and overfitting control. You’ll be able to construct ML-driven portfolios with robust risk controls, realistic transaction costs, and statistically defensible performance.



**4.) Market Microstructure, Execution \& Strategy Optimization**

* An Introduction to Market Microstructure Theory by Andreas Krause
* The Science of Algorithmic Trading and Portfolio Management by Kissel
* The Evaluation and Optimization of Trading Strategies by Robert Pardo
* Machine Learning in Finance by dixon



**Skills I'll gain after completing:** You’ll understand how real markets work at the trade-by-trade level, including liquidity, impact, slippage, and execution algorithms. You’ll be able to stress-test, optimize, and deploy strategies in live conditions while avoiding data-snooping and false optimization.

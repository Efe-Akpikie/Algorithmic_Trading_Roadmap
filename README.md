# Statistical Finance & Financial Machine Learning  
## A Five-Course Professional Quantitative Trading & Research Sequence

---

## Program Overview

This program is designed as a **serious, professional-grade quant formation track**, not a casual learning path.  
It progresses deliberately from statistical foundations → system realism → time-series & portfolio theory → market structure → research-grade financial machine learning.

The sequence emphasizes:
- Statistical rigor over backtest performance
- Economic plausibility over curve-fitting
- Research hygiene over model complexity
- Portfolio and risk realism over single-signal thinking

**Total duration:** ~24–27 months  
**Structure:** 5 core courses + 1 final institutional-grade capstone

## Final Note

This curriculum is intentionally demanding.  
Its purpose is not to **teach trading**, but to teach **how to think like a professional quantitative researcher** who understands why most strategies fail before they ever trade.
